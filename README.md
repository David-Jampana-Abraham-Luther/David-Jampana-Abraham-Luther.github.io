🛠️ How I Built This Portfolio Website
This project was created to showcase my data analytics and cybersecurity work in a sleek, responsive portfolio website. I built it from scratch using HTML and CSS, applying a dark, modern design inspired by tech dashboards.

To enhance interactivity and aesthetics, I used:

🎨 Custom CSS: For layout, color themes, responsiveness, and styling elements like cards and buttons.

⚡ ScrollReveal.js: For smooth scroll-based animations that make the site feel dynamic and engaging.

🌐 Font Awesome: For clean, scalable icons in the contact section.

🖼️ Profile Image: Optimized and styled with shadow effects and rounded borders.

The project is entirely static and lightweight — ideal for fast loading and easy deployment on GitHub Pages.
## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5 & CSS3 (custom styles)
- ScrollReveal.js (animations)
- GitHub Pages (deployment)
- Visual Studio Code (editor)
